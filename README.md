# 🐾 Badge(r)s — Unofficial Bug Tracker

Welcome!  
This repo is **the community-run place to report bugs and glitches** you encounter in **Badge(r)s**, the Android location-based game of collecting and trading virtual badges.

## ➡️ How to report a bug
1. **Open a new Issue** and choose **“Bug report”**.  
2. Fill out every field in the template:  
   - **Steps to reproduce** (clear, numbered)  
   - **Expected vs. actual result**  
   - **Screenshots / screen recording** (if possible)  
   - **Device, Android version & app version**  
3. Click **Submit**—that’s it!

> *Please search existing issues first to avoid duplicates.*

## ✨ Feature requests
Have a gameplay idea instead of a bug?  
Use the **“Feature request”** template so we can keep the trackers separate.

## 🤝 Contributing
Pull requests that **fix confirmed issues** are welcome!  
Be sure to reference the Issue number in your PR description.

## 📜 Disclaimer
This repository is **not** maintained by the official Badge(r)s development team.  
It is a community effort to help improve the game.
